            <p>
                WELCOME!!! My name is Jessie. I am visually impaired and have been using screen readers to navigate the
                computer for the past 20 years. I have used many websites throughout my professional career and have
                seen some online platforms which are very accessible and some which are more challenging to navigate. My
                interest in web accessibility and how to make the internet a more comprehensive space has fueled my
                desire to become an accessibility consultant. My goal is to help individuals, companies, and small
                businesses meet WCAG 2.2 compliance while also inspecting the accessibility of the website as a human
                tester. I have been developing my skillsets to be an excellent consultant and advocate for accessibility
                in the online space and am dedicated to find solutions for you and your online platforms. I look forward
                to working with you!
            </p>
